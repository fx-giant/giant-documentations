`deal` --> Table that includes all the information about deals sold by 8excite e.g. **title**, **selling_price**, **category** etc. This table is unique to **id** which is the deal id. There may be repeated deal titles because deal titles are not unique data row identifiers. The deal ids are unique and can be used to differentiate the deals.
