# Analysing Your Data Using Top 10 and Cross Chart Functions with GIANT 

## Introduction
This guide is to show you the top 10 and cross chart functions in GIANT and how to use it to show top 10 products in your analytics works. This guide includes instructions on:
- How to create a pie chart to show the total buyers by the gender category and a data matrix for top 10 products
- How the cross chart function aids the analysis of top 10 products bought by the buyers in each of the gender category
- Cross-chart is an important function used to deepen your analysis. It becomes particularly useful when analyzing specific groups within the data.
- When a single chart cannot display all the given information, cross-chart may be more helpful in displaying that information using two or more charts.

### Prerequisites
* Have an account to access GIANT
* A data source to use for visualization

## Uploading Source to GIANT and Creating a Dashboard
1. In case you are new to GIANT, refer to [GIANT for Beginner](https://github.com/fx-giant/giant-documentations/blob/master/giant/giant-for-beginner.md) to learn on how to upload source, create a dashboard and charts in GIANT.

2. Download `Car sales.csv` in [sample-data folder](sample-data), then upload it in GIANT.

3. Create a dashboard with the name: **Use cross filter to aid top 10 products visualization in GIANT**

### Background

Company A is in the business of selling cars. Company A wants to know the breakdown of its overall transactions by gender and the top 10 purchased cars.

### Determine the Total Transactions by Gender

Company A wants to know the total cars purchased by male and female customers. Company A needs this information in order to better understand their consumer base. To visualise this, a Gender pie chart can be created to get a clear view on total transactions by gender

1. From your dashboard, click the `Add` icon, then choose the `Pie` chart icon and click the `Source` icon.

2. Select `Car sales.csv` from `Connection Source Seletion` and click the `Proceed` icon.

3. Rename the pie chart as "Total transactions by Gender".

4. In the `Setting` area, select **gender** for the `Category-Axis` and `Count` of **order_id** for the `Value-Axis`. `Count` of **order_id** represents the number of transactions made by the consumers. This is our given output:

5. In the `Setting` panel, scroll down and make sure that the `Cross Chart` function is turned on (as shown in the screenshot).

6. Click `Save` and choose the dashboard that you created earlier to save the pie chart into.

### Displaying Top 10 Purchased Cars Information

To further the analysis, there needs to be a data matrix to display the information of top 10 purchased cars (which corresponds to the number of transactions, sorted in descending order).

1. From your dashboard, click on `Add` icon, select `Data Matrix` icon and click `Source` icon. 

    ![Create Data Matrix](./images/analysing-using-top-10-and-crossfilter/3-selectDataMatrix.PNG)

2. Choose `Car sales.csv` and click `Proceed` icon.

3. Rename the data matrix as "Top 10 purchased cars information".

4. Under the `Column(s)` section, click `Add Dimensions(s)` and choose the **car_maker** column. Rename the column label as *Car Maker* and click `Apply`.

    ![Select Car Maker](./images/analysing-using-top-10-and-crossfilter/4.1-selectCarMaker.PNG)

5. Choose **car_model** as another dimension. Rename the column label as "Car Model" and click `Apply`.

6. Click `Add Measurement(s)` and choose `Count` of **order_id** column. Rename the column label as *Total Transactions* and click `Apply`.

    ![Select Features](./images/analysing-using-top-10-and-crossfilter/4.2-selectFeatures.PNG)

7. Under `Sort(s)`, drag `car_id` column to the first position. Then, click it and choose `Descending`. The data matrix will display information of the cars with the highest number of transactions first.

    ![Sort Descending](./images/analysing-using-top-10-and-crossfilter/5-sortDescending.PNG)

8. Currently the data matrix displays the information of all cars. To display only the top 10 cars, use the `Top` function. Under `All/Top/Bottom`, click `All` and choose `Top`, enter 10 as the value and click `Set`. Now, only the top 10 products are displayed in the data matrix.

### Using the Cross Chart Filter Function to Aid the Analysis

In the dashboard, the top 10 purchased cars information for both male and female customers can be seen.

![Top 10 All](./images/analysing-using-top-10-and-crossfilter/7-top10All.PNG)

Now we can use the `Cross Chart` function to visualize the top 10 purchased cars among the male customers. In the pie chart, click the Male segment to see the "magic".

By clicking on the Male segment in the pie chart, you can visualise the top 10 cars purchased by the Male customers, Female customers or both genders of customers. This can be important as Company A might want to come up with new marketing strategies by segementing their customer base by gender. An example is advertising specific car models to their customers based on the top 10 most popular car models popular among each gender.
