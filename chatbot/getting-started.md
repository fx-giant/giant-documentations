## Quick Replies

The _Quick Replies_ response type allows the user to select one of the options provided with no typing needed from the user. This response type aids user in providing a reply based on the options listed out for the user to choose from. The _Quick Replies_ response type enables you to display text combined with a series of action buttons as options for user's selection.

- Example: The following intents are configured with the _Quick Replies_ response type:
	- Intent **Default Welcome Intent**
	- Intent **inquiry_animal-pics**
	- Intent **recommend_join-as-member**

- Example: The following intents are configured with the _card_ response type:
	- Intent **inquiry_animal-pics**
	- Intent **show_quick-menu**
	- Intent **show_help-menu**

- Example: The following intent is configured with the _Rich Text Response_ response type:
	- Intent **inquiry_operating-hours**

    ![inquiry_operating-hours-rich-text](https://github.com/fx-giant/giant-documentations/blob/master/chatbot/images5/inquiry_operating-hours-rich-text.png)

## Event

The _Event_ response type is to enable the Second Intent to be automatically triggered after the First Intent is triggered. 

- Example: After the First Intent **inquiry_animal-pics** is triggered, the Second Intent **recommend_join-as-member** is automatically triggered. The Second Intent contains the Event **event_join-as-a-member**, configured in Dialogflow. As a result, after the user requests to view the animal pictures, the chatbot will recommend the user to join the Animal Association as a member.

	- First Intent **inquiry_animal-pics**
	- Second Intent **recommend_join-as-member** (contains the Event **event_join-as-a-member**)
