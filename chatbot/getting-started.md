## Part 3: Managing Responses for Intents

In this section, we will showcase the suitable response type to apply based on the user's inquiry type.

## Quick Replies
The _Quick Replies_ response type allows the user to select one of the options provided with no typing needed from the user. This response type aids user in providing a reply based on the options listed out for the user to choose from. The _Quick Replies_ response type enables you to display text combined with a series of action buttons as options for user's selection.

- Example: Intent related to **show_quick-menu**

## Card
The _Card_ response type is suitable to use when images with hyperlinks are needed to be shown as a reply. This response type enables you to display images with action buttons for user to click.

- Example: Intent for **inquiry_animal-pics**

## Rich Text Response
The _Rich Text Response_ response type is suitable to use when you need to include formatted text, hyperlinks, pictures or video content as part of your response to the user. 

- Example: Intent **inquiry_operating-hours**

## Event
The _Event_ response type is to enable the Second Intent to be shown after the First Intent is triggered. 

- Example: The First Intent **inquiry_animal-pics** is triggered, followed by the Second Intent **show_membership-form**. The Second Intent contains the Event **event_join-club**

	![Event 2](https://github.com/fx-giant/giant-documentations/blob/master/chatbot/images5/event_2.png)

## Occurrence Event
The _Occurrence Event_ response type is set up to trigger another Intent once a particular Intent has been triggered for certain number of times. 

- Example: After the Intent **Default Fallback Intent** is triggered continuously for several times, another Intent **show_help-menu** with the Event **event_help-menu** is triggered so that the conversation can proceed.

## Change Language
The _Change Language_ response type is configured in an Intent to enable the language switching action. 

- Example: The Intent **show_language-options** is created to allow capturing the _User Says_ in **English**, **Chinese** and other supported languages.
