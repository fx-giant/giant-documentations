|cm|centimetres|
|mm|millimetres|
|in|inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)|
|px|pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)|
|pt|points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)|
|pc|picas (1pc = 12pt)|

### Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

|Unit|Description|
|---|---|
|em|Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
|ex|Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)|
|ch|Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)|
|rem|Relative to font-size of the root element|
|vw|Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*|
|vh|Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*|
|vmin|Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension|
|vmax|Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension|
