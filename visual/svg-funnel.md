# SVG Funnel

## Introduction
The SVG Funnel is a visual that uses an image to represent the categories and values in a chart. There are two types available, depending on the chart mode that you choose for the chart:

**a) Type 1 - Stacked SVG Funnel**   
Stacked SVG Funnel is a spiced up variation of a regular stacked bar or column chart. It uses an image to provide an overview of the categories, represented in segments. Each segment corresponds to the value of each category.

**b) Type 2 - Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**   
Non-Stacked SVG Funnel is a pictograph which shows data using images. A pictograph uses picture symbols to convey the meaning of statistical information. Each picture symbol stands for a certain value.

## Visual Configuration   
After selecting the chart to add to your dashboard, you will see the following data binding fields shown in the **Setting** panel:

![chart-setting-panel](./images/svg-funnel/chart-setting-panel.png)

- **Description**: Fill-in the **description** for the chart in this field.
- **Connection Source**: Specify the data source from which the Categories and Values in chart would be displayed.
- **Name**: Column in the data source which contains the **Category** values.
- **Value**: Column in the data source which contains the **Values** for the Categories.
- **Color**: Colour code to use for the image(s) shown in the Chart \**.
- **Choose File**: Choose the SVG image to use in the chart (only SVG format is supported).
- **Icon SVG Path**: Instead of uploading an SVG image, you can specify the image using the SVG Path \** .
- **IsStack**: **Enable** the toggle to get a **Stacked SVG Funnel**, otherwise **disable** the toggle to get a **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**.   
   
- **Display Orientation**: Applicable for **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**. Choose either to display the images in **Horizontal** or **Vertical** orientation.
- **Show Maximum Number of Icon**: Applicable for **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**. **Enable** the toggle to get the **maximum number of icons** shown for each Category (which is the same as the number of icons shown for the category with the highest value).
- **Display Label**: Applicable for **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**. You can choose to display the **Value**, **Percentage** or both **Value and Percentage**.
- **Show Number with Suffix**: Applicable for **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**. When you **enable** the toggle, large numbers are shown as **formatted values** (i.e. 100,000 is shown as 100.00K).
- **Color**: Applicable for **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**. Select the colour to apply to the image.
- **Scale**: Applicable for **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**. The scale to apply for each image (e.g. one image is equivalent to 10,000 units).   
- **Filter(s)**: Apply **filter** to restrict the data shown in the chart.
- **Cross Chart**: Enable the toggle to turn on the Cross Chart Filter feature for the chart.

The next sections provide more details on the data bindings which are specific to the **Stacked SVG Funnel** and **Non-Stacked SVG Funnel**.

### Data Binding for Stacked SVG Funnel
To get this chart, you need to **enable** the **IsStack** toggle

![IsStack Toggle](./images/svg-funnel/isStack-toggle.PNG)

The image below shows the fields related to the chart's data bindings.

![Stacked Bindings](./images/svg-funnel/stacked-bindings.PNG)
 
- The required bindings are 1 dimension and 1 measurement.
    > **Name** will be the dimension and **Value** will be the measurement.
- The **Color** field is an optional binding.
- The values from the **Name** field will be shown as the label for each category. The area or height of the segments in the image is auto-calculated from the **Value** field binding. The value from the **Color** field will determine the color of each segment.
- You can also use the Color Palette to configure the color of the image. 
    > NOTE: If a valid data binding for the **Color** field is provided, the selected **Color Palette** will be ignored.
    
    ![colour-pallete](./images/svg-funnel/colour-pallete.png)
    
- Upload an SVG image (click on **Choose File** button to do so) or use the **Icon SVG Path** to set the image displayed in the chart.

- You can get the sample SVG [here](./sample-data/svg-funnel/sample-svg/sample.svg).
    > Copy and paste the svg path to see the below output.
![Example SVG Path](./images/svg-funnel/sample-svg.PNG)

- If **SVG file** is not provided or **Icon SVG Path** not specified, the default human icon will be used.
    > NOTE: If the SVG file is provided, the **Icon SVG Path** will be ignored.
    
- Here's the Sample Output of the chart with completed data bindings.

### Data Binding for Non-Stacked SVG Funnel
To get this chart, you need to **disable** the **IsStack** toggle

![disable-isStack-toggle](./images/svg-funnel/disable-isStack-toggle.png)

The image below shows the fields related to the chart's data bindings.

![Non Stacked Bindings](./images/svg-funnel/non-stacked-bindings.png)

- The required bindings are 1 dimension and 1 measurement.
    > **Name** will be the dimension and **Value** will be the measurement.
- The **Color** field is an optional binding.
- The values from the **Name** field will be shown as the label for each category. The number of icons shown for each category is auto-calculated from the **Value** field binding and the value specified in the **Scale** field. The value from the **Color** field will determine the color of the icon.    
- Upload an SVG image (click on **Choose File** button to do so) or use the **Icon SVG Path** to set the image displayed in the chart.

- **Display Orientation**: Select the value to display the icons in **Horizontal** or **Vertical** orientation.
- **Show Maximum Number of Icon**: Enable the toggle to show the maximum number of icons for each Category (it will be the same as the number of icons shown for the category with the highest value).

    ![Show Maximum Number of Icon](./images/svg-funnel/show-maximum-number-of-icons.PNG)
