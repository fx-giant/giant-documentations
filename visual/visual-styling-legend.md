# Visual styling : Legend 

## Introduction:

This guide will show how to properly use legends when creating charts in GIANT.

## Example 1:

![piechart](images/giant-101-legend/pie1.PNG)

This pie chart shows the **percentage of the total number of sales within each region**. As we can see, the legend shows the different regions within each category. However, since this chart already labels the data, we do not need the legend.

![legend](images/giant-101-legend/legend.PNG)

Click the **hamburger icon** at the top right of the screen. Click **legend**, followed by the **no legend** option. This is the given output:

![pieimproved](images/giant-101-legend/pie2.PNG)

Even though we do not have a legend anymore, we do not lose any information we want to convey to our target audience. The **percentage of total sales within each region** is still clearly shown to the viewer.


**Important Note**: Legends are normally used when it can provide information the current chart itself cannot convey to the user.

## Example 2:

![linechart](images/giant-101-legend/line1.PNG)


In this example, this line chart shows the **profit growth of a single company across months grouped by years**. In this case, using a legend is important here because users are able to distinguish which line represents which year.

![linechart2](images/giant-101-legend/line2.PNG)

If the line chart did not have any legend, the target audience could not tell which line represents the profit growth in which year. Without a legend, we lose important information that is key in telling the story from this chart.

## Summary:

Always think of how the legend affects the showcased information. If removing the legend causes a loss in key information for the target audience, keep it. However, depending on circumstances, consider keeping/removing the legend depending on the visual aesthetic of the chart. Decide on whether keeping the legend is appropriate based on the aesthetic and information parts of the chart.
