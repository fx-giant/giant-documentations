### Customer Service on Social Media
Most if not all companies today have their own social media pages because of its customer traffic,
accessibility from anywhere, anytime and the low costs to market your business. Customers could reach out to
customer service quicker than ever nowadays with the use of social media and some businesses even provide
real-time customer serivce online and have their social media managers monitoring their social media and
make responses accordingly.

To monitor its page's posts, reactions and comments, a social media widget consisting of two of the largest
social media platforms worldwide, Facebook and Twitter, is needed. You could also utilise it to monitor
other pages such that you are analysing your competitors.

|Bindings|Select|

|Facebook Page Url|https://www.facebook.com/FusionexInternational|

Configure the Twitter widget with settings as follows:

|Bindings|Select|

|Twitter Id|FusionexInt|

Other settings that are not mentioned in the tables above, are just aesthethic settings which will not have any
significant impact.

**Analysis**

By using the social widgets, a social media manager or online customer service could monitor any available 
page on Facebook/Twitter as long as the posts are visible to the public, including reactions, shares and 
comments. It is also clickable where it directs you to the particular post if any changes to the post is
needed or replying feedback.
