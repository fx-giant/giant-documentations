# Embedded View

![Embedded View](./images/embedded-view/embedded-view.PNG)

Embedded View allows you to include an entire webpage for users to view it within GIANT dashboard. Using this component allows you to complement your dashboard by adding external content, in which the content is in the form of a website.

## Data Binding

There are only two fields for this chart, which are **URL** and **Sandbox Parameters**. **URL** is the only mandatory field and **Sandbox Parameters** is optional. 

Do kindly take note that only websites that allow embedded view will work in this visual. Some websites disallow embedded view for security reasons. As for the **Sandbox Parameters**, the acceptable values are as shown in the table below:

|Value|Description|
|---|---|
|(no value)|Applies all restrictions|
|allow-forms|Allows form submission|
|allow-modals|Allows to open modal windows|
|allow-orientation-lock|Allows to lock the screen orientation|
|allow-pointer-lock|Allows to use the Pointer Lock API|
|allow-popups|Allows popups|
|allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox|Allows popups to open new windows without inheriting the sandboxing|
|allow-presentation|Allows to start a presentation session|
|allow-same-origin|Allows the iframe content to be treated as being from the same origin|
|allow-scripts|Allows to run scripts|
|allow-top-navigation|Allows the iframe content to navigate its top-level browsing context|
|allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation|Allows the iframe content to navigate its top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by user|


## Use Case 1

### Embedded Website, Video & Actionable Button

There are more than one way to utilise the Embedded View visual. You could embed a website, as long as the website allows embedded view (some websites do not allow embedded feature due to security reasons). You could embed a YouTube video, also embed an actionable button like Twitter's Tweet button. Just ensure that the content to embed is accessible via a valid URL, for you to configure the URL field binding for the visual.

Three different Embedded View charts could be generated with configuration as follows:

|Bindings|Input Value|
|---|---|
|URL|http://www.fusionexgiant.com|
|URL|https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2JtvuPMLRo|
|URL|https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.html|

**Output**

![Embedded View](./images/embedded-view/embedded-view-output-1.PNG)

The output image above shows an example of onboarding dashboard in which there is an embedded view of Fusionex's website for users to navigate through the website without having to open up a new browser window or tab. On the second embedded view chart, there is an embedded YouTube video on Fusionex's donation for users to learn about the corporate social responsibility of Fusionex. Lastly, on the third embedded view chart, there is an embedded Tweet button that directs users to Tweet about their onboarding experience after going through the session, hence the button is placed at the last chart.


## Use Case 2

### Embedded View as a Supporting Visual

Embedded View can be used as a supporting visual as well, for users to visit the website if interested without having to open up a new browser window or tab.

The chart could be generated with configuration as follows:

|Bindings|Input Value|
|---|---|
|URL|http://www.fusionexgiant.com|

**Output**

The output image above shows an example of a dashboard which showcases several data-driven charts with embedded view as a supporting chart at the bottom of the dashboard for users to interact with the website itself to learn more about the company mentioned in the dashboard.
