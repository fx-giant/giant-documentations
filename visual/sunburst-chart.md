# Sunburst Chart

Sunburst chart is an illustration of categorical data to show the effect of different categories on the overall data. It is able to illustrate data for multiple levels of categories.The chart can be utilized to see which category of data has a larger effect, making it more important. It is more efficient than a regular chart because the releationship between different catgeories can be seen in one whole pie chart. The size of a slice is able to show the effect of a particular category and value on the overall data. It is typically used for data such as total sales as it is able to filter the sales generated by many different categories and illustrate each category's impact.

## Diagram Design / Configuration

### Binding
- The bindings required are only 1 dimension and 1 measuremnent binding.  
- Only 1 dimension binding is required despite multiple dimension bindings are available.
- There can be multiple dimension bindings which creates more layers in the sunburst chart.
    >The bindings are Category Path(s) for dimension and Value Path for measurement

## Use Case
---

### Sales Analysis of Apple Retail Products 
The dataset for this use case is a combined sales report of Apple product sales from January to June. The sales report consist of rows with information on each Apple product purchasal over the 6 months. It has information such as date purchased, store purchased, state store is located, units purchased, customer gender/age and more. 

Sample data can be downloaded here: data.xlsx

The first example of how the sunburst chart can be utilized in this case is by using the state the store is located together with the customer gender and age columns in the dataset. The bindings for this dataset would be putting data.state, data.gender and data.age as the multiple dimension bindings while the only measurement binding in this case would be the sum of sales. Here is a table for better understanding corresponding to the setting controls.

|Bindings |Data Type|
|---|---|
|Category Path|state|
|Category Path|gender|
|Catehory Path|age|
|Value Path|Sum of sales|

### Output


### Analysis

From the graph, we can see how different categories contribute to the total sales. We can tell that
