# Timeline Chart
Timeline chart is typically used to show a specific or huge event happening on a company or an individual profile 

## Diagram Design / Configuration
---
### Binding
- The bindings required are 2 dimensions binding 
    >Date and event name for dimensions

### Diagram label align Order
There are three options for this configuration which are *Alternate*, *Above*, *Below*. The default option is *Alternate*.
- Alternate: Arrange the label position to be above - below  the bullet alternatively.
- Above: Arrange all of the labels to be positioned above the bullet.
- Below: Arrange all of the labels to be positioned below the bullet.

## Incompatible data source 
- The data source should not contain 
    - Unmodified Date format , it should present DD-MM-YYYY 

- For the above cases, "INVALID DATE" will occur on the Date label

## Unhandled conditions
- Date bindings from Date 1 to Date 2 are too short / long ( extreme ) since the chart xValue(date) the distance between Date1 to Date2 are proportional among all distance

- Too much data, when the data is too much, it would make the labels very hard to read 

- Haven't implemented a scrollbar to scroll the timeline to left / right
